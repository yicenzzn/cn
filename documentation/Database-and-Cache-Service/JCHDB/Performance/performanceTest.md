# 性能测试指南

 本文以On Time和Star Schema数据集为例，介绍如何将测试数据集导入分析型云数据库ClickHouse并完成性能测试。

## 前提条件

已完成快速入门的如下步骤：

* 已创建分析型云数据库ClickHouse集群，[新建实例](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/jchdb/create-instance1)

* 已创建数据库账号，参考[创建账号](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/jchdb/create-account1)

* 已准备一台Linux系统的机器，并将Linux机器的IP地址添加到云数据库ClickHouse集群的白名单中，参考[设置白名单](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/jchdb/setwhitelist) 

* 已安装与分析型云数据库ClickHouse集群版本对应的clickhouse-client工具，参考[连接实例](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/jchdb/Connect-Instance1) 

## 测试说明

本测试中的所有clickhouse-client命令均在clickhouse-client客户端的安装目录下执行。

本测试中使用的On Time和Star Schema数据集均引用自ClickHouse开源网站。更多信息，请参见。[示例数据集](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/getting-started/example-datasets/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.6bd41d84tEEahP) 

## On Time数据集测试
### 1. 连接集群
在Linux环境中使用clickhouse-client工具连接分析型云数据库ClickHouse集群。

```
./clickhouse-client --host=<数据库连接地址> --port=<TCP端口号> --user=<数据库账号> --password=<数据库账号的密码>
```

### 2. 建表
请根据分析型云数据库ClickHouse集群的规格下载正确的建表语句脚本并执行。

* [单副本集群的建表语句](../../../../image/JCHDB/ontime_one_replicate.sql)

* [双副本集群的建表语句](../../../../image/JCHDB/ontime_two_replicate.sql)

### 3.下载On Time数据

**说明** 

On Time数据集覆盖的时间区间非常大，下载数据时间较长，同时数据下载过程中会遇到一部分数据已丢失的错误。

```
echo https://transtats.bts.gov/PREZIP/On_Time_Reporting_Carrier_On_Time_Performance_1987_present_{1987..2021}_{1..12}.zip | xargs -P10 wget --no-check-certificate --continue
```

### 4. 导入数据至云数据库ClickHouse

请根据如下Shell命令，正确配置ck_url、ck_user、ck_pass和ck_port环境变量，再进行数据导入。

```
export ck_url=<数据库连接地址>
export ck_user=<数据库账号> 
export ck_pass=<数据库账号的密码>
export ck_port=<TCP端口号> 
for i in *.zip; do echo $i; unzip -cq $i '*.csv' | sed 's/\.00//g' | ./clickhouse-client -h $ck_url -u $ck_user --password $ck_pass --port $ck_port --query="INSERT INTO ontime FORMAT CSVWithNames"; done
```

## Star Schema数据集测试

### 1.连接集群

在Linux环境中使用clickhouse-client工具连接云数据库ClickHouse集群。

```
./clickhouse-client --host=<数据库连接地址> --port=<TCP端口号> --user=<数据库账号> --password=<数据库账号的密码>
```

### 2. 建表

请根据分析型云数据库ClickHouse集群的规格下载正确的建表语句脚本并执行。

* [单副本集群的建表语句](../../../../image/JCHDB/starschema_one_replicate.sql)
* [双副本集群的建表语句](../../../../image/JCHDB/starschema_two_replicate.sql)

### 3. 生成数据文件

请根据如下Shell命令，首先克隆数据生成项目ssb-dbgen，然后通过make编译，用命令生成数据文件customer.tbl、lineorder.tbl、part.tbl和supplier.tbl。

**说明** 

示例中`-s 100`参数会产生大概6亿行的数据（67 GB），您可以根据情况适当调整测试数据量。

```
git clone https://github.com/vadimtk/ssb-dbgen.git
cd ssb-dbgen
make
./dbgen -s 100 -T c
./dbgen -s 100 -T l
./dbgen -s 100 -T p
./dbgen -s 100 -T s
```

### 4. 导入数据至云数据库ClickHouse

请根据如下Shell命令，正确配置ck_url、ck_user、ck_pass和ck_port环境变量，再进行数据导入。

```
export ck_url=<数据库连接地址>
export ck_user=<数据库账号>
export ck_pass=<数据库账号的密码>
export ck_port=<TCP端口号> 
./clickhouse-client -h <数据库连接地址> -u <数据库账号> --password <数据库账号的密码> --port <TCP端口号> --query "INSERT INTO customer FORMAT CSV" < ssb-dbgen/customer.tbl
./clickhouse-client -h <数据库连接地址> -u <数据库账号> --password <数据库账号的密码> --port <TCP端口号> --query "INSERT INTO part FORMAT CSV" < ssb-dbgen/part.tbl
./clickhouse-client -h <数据库连接地址> -u <数据库账号> --password <数据库账号的密码> --port <TCP端口号> --query "INSERT INTO supplier FORMAT CSV" < ssb-dbgen/supplier.tbl
./clickhouse-client -h <数据库连接地址> -u <数据库账号> --password <数据库账号的密码> --port <TCP端口号> --query "INSERT INTO lineorder FORMAT CSV" < ssb-dbgen/lineorder.tbl
```
